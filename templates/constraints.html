        Due consideration to be given to all external stakeholders and the influences associated to the construction processes and technical systems, which may define the requirements of a 4D BIM software application. Each associated element within a project specific set of constraints are derived from a list of three elements: time, cost and quality. To reinforce the DSS process, these three elements are further defined by creating three sub-sets each of, which offer the ability to establish the specific project requirement definitions.
    </p>
    <p align="middle" class="bim-page-sub-title" style="font-style: italic">Time</p>
    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Sector Type: </p>
    <p>The Sector controlling the 4D BIM construction project and the contributing factors that may be associated to the success of the construction management project.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Site logistics: </p>
    <p>Project landscape and the associated constraints of the workspace. This is determined by considering the ability to utilize the characteristics of the workspace to optimize efficiency and ensure against confined space conflict, which may include resource control. The ability to reveal the visual construction process and determine the inter-dependencies of time, space and resources within the site environment. Which can lead to better decision-making for design development, schedule estimation and construction tasks including; resource allocation and site safety.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Project Duration: </p>
    <p>Schedule of project, from design phase to hand-over phase of the asset.</p>
    <br>
    <p align="middle" class="bim-page-sub-title" style="font-style: italic">Cost</p>
    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Resource Control:</p>
    <p>The access, availability and allocation of resources associated with the projectâ€™s financial investment plan and associated resource control may define the quality requirement of 4D simulations and predict resource overlaps within the project schedule and the formulated approach used for construction activities and the allocation of the resources among activities.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Financial cost of project:</p>
    <p>The cost of the 4D BIM project from design phase to hand-over phase.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Waste control:</p>
    <p>Site Waste Management Plans (SWMPs) are put in place to aid in the planning procedures used to set out and maintain a continuous management strategy. Used to reduce, reuse and/or recycle building materials throughout the lifecycle of a CM project.</p>
    <p>Although there is no legal requirement to develop an SWMP, a private sector project and its management team may be required to implement a strategy to reduce building waste. Consideration of latent energy use in the form of materials that require importing and the sourcing of alternative local materials may reduce the projects carbon footprint.</p>
    <br>

    <p align="middle" class="bim-page-sub-title" style="font-style: italic">Quality</p>
    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Procurement Method:</p>
    <p>Several constraints including the locality, financial and/or resource availability etc. are used to access, which contractual method is best suited for the project.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Technical Complexity:</p>
    <p>This may have a bearing on the level of collaboration needed amongst the design and construction teams, with subsequent data validation throughout the design phase according to the projects Employers Information Requirements (EIR). </p>
    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Carbon Footprint:</p>
    <p>The environmental planning required, which has a direct impact on the waste management procedures incorporated in the project.</p>
