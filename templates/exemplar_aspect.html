    <p>An organisations information requirements (OIR) need to be established when deciding to implement (4D) BIM within an organisation, which is a decision with a number of elements of risk involved including the financial outlay for hardware, software and the 4D BIM training required of an organisation’s stakeholders involved within the supply chain. There is a lack of technical information available to organisations/end- users and a number of concerns are apparent, regarding the choices presented when choosing a 4D BIM software application. These include interoperability issues of each BIM software application file formats and the induced risk of data corruption and data validity, to facilitate collaboration across multiple disciplines from a 4D BIM perspective, it is essential for the safety of data transfer to coordinate workflows to achieve effective project productivity. Depending on a projects stakeholder knowledge of 4D BIM and the use of the software application to coordinate CM, the degree of ease of use is an important factor for project stakeholders to be involved within the projects collaborative environment, facilitated through 4D BIM technology. The effective use of a 4D BIM software application requires knowledge of the risk analysis capabilities and the manipulation of a federated 4D BIM model between multiple disciplines. As well as to have an understanding of continuous updates to a project schedule, task process simulations, temporary structure logistics and produce clash detections (defining rules) between multiple-disciplines.</p>

    <p>Quality management of a construction project begins at the planning stage, which sets out a scheduled number of quality assurance checks, where by a series of surveys are carried out throughout a 4D BIM project, enabling the quality control of quality issues. A quality management process when incorporated into a structured analytical means of capturing and recording changes to construction elements can enhance quality control through visualisation techniques. To increase productivity, quality control and a reduced number of RFI’s throughout the life cycle of a project collaboration at the planning stage is essential. Through the use of a common data environment (CDE) (an online destination, which is used to save, organise and share project data) as a requirement of the EIR, it is possible for project stakeholders to collaborate and exchange ideas.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Visualisation capabilities of the appropriate 4D BIM software application may be a valuable asset for an organisation, where it has the capability to show stakeholders a comparative analysis of planned value (PV) of a project against actual cost value (AC) according to cost estimations for a given point in the schedule to improve the efficiency and productivity of CM, throughout each stage of a 4D BIM project. An organisations reputation may be enhanced through public opinion, on their stance to address the urgency of global warming and contribute to carbon emission reductions, crucial to sustainability realised through the use of 4D BIM to minimize construction waste production and may be considered to be improving CM on a global scale, minimizing the carbon footprint of construction. The use of clash detection is of major importance when used to offset waste, through a systematic approach to CM planning and efficient construction practices, which may provide quality assurances as a direct result of lean 4D BIM practices.</p>
